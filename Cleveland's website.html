      Sometimes life can be stressful. <br>
     Perhaps you are going through a hard time. <br>
     Perhaps you are rushing an coding assignment that's due tomorrow.<br>
     Either way, some music can help you relax, unwind, and release your stress. <br>
       Here are some of my favourites: </h2>

>    <h2><a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvazBqAlx58">1. Put your head on my shoulder - Paul Anka</a></h2>
      <p>
        This song gives a soothing, carefree, happy-go-lucky ambience to your man-cave, masking away all your problems by painting a vivid dream-like fantasy in your head.

      <h2><a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iP0tHmoc1rs">2. It's been a long, long time - Kitty Kallen</a></h2>
      <p>
        Another olden but golden song. It really takes you back to the 1940s, a trance of nostalgia and beauty. You'll be lulled into forgetting all your problems.

      <h2><a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvRBv1NSOtQ">3. Homage - Mild High Club</a></h2>
      <p>
        Perhaps this is the musical expression of an Artist's mind. This song has a soothing, numbing effect on you. Fitting of the band name, don't you think?

      <h2><a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWZwYLjC75c">4. Someone to spend time with - Los Retros</a></h2>
      <p>
        Slow, charming and sweet. Its heart-warming vibe is truly like a cup on hot chocolate with fluffy marshmellows on a cool cloudy afternoon.

      <h2><a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_k53NIp0QU">5. My Jinji - Sunset Rollercoaster</a></h2>
      <p>
        When I stumbled upon this song, I didn't quite know how to describe it. The more I tried to catergorize it, the more frustrated I got. Then I gave up, and found that I enjoyed the music more.
